## Support
-----------

If you are having trouble installing or using Amahi, you have multiple ways to get help.

* The [Wiki](http://wiki.amahi.org), with a large amount of fairly up-to-date information on Amahi
* The [Bug tracker](http://bugs.amahi.org), where you can search for issues or create new ones
* The [Forums](http://forums.amahi.org), the community forums, where you can ask questions and receive answers from Amahi experts
* The `#amahi` channel on Freenode for live chat (via IRC). Also available via this [IRC web interface](http://talk.amahi.org). Ask your question and wait for a bit for an answer, as people come and go.

If you are a subscriber of the [Amahi Premium plans](http://www.amahi.org/plans), you can also email the customer support email at the address you received upon subscription or in your Amahi control panel.
