These are the files used to construct Amahi.net. 

Amahi.net is the default domain used in Amahi Home Server installations. If there is trouble with an installation or someone does not switch off DCHP in their router, they may end up at this site - outside of their home network.

This is a small site dedicated providing useful tips and troubleshooting links.
